## What Codex chat is for

Codex chat is the integrated agent interface in CoCalc-ai. A project chat thread
can include humans and Codex, and Codex can use project-aware tools to inspect
files, run commands, work with notebooks, and make changes.

## Open Codex

1. Open the project.
2. Open the Agents or chat area.
3. Start a Codex thread.
4. Ask a concrete task, including relevant files and constraints.

For terminal-native agents such as Claude Code or opencode, install and run them
inside a normal project terminal. CoCalc provides the durable Linux environment;
those tools provide their own agent interface.

## Give better tasks

Name files, describe the desired outcome, and ask Codex to validate changes.
For live notebooks, ask Codex to use the live notebook APIs. For UI actions,
docs action ids such as \`settings.environment.secrets\` let agents open the
right panel directly.

## Why this matters in CoCalc

CoCalc is both a collaborative workspace and an agent sandbox. Humans can review
what Codex changes, keep terminals and notebooks running, use TimeTravel, and
share the same project state with collaborators.

export const AI_CREDENTIALS_BODY = String.raw`
## What AI credentials are for

CoCalc-ai uses OpenAI access for integrated Codex chat. A user can connect a
ChatGPT subscription or configure an OpenAI API key, depending on what access
the deployment and account support.

## Connect access for Codex

1. Open Codex or the AI settings area.
2. Choose **Sign in with ChatGPT** or configure an OpenAI API key.
3. Complete the device authorization or key setup flow.
4. Return to the Codex thread and start a concrete task.

If device authorization is running, keep the authorization panel visible until
the browser confirms that the account is connected.

## Choose the payment source for a thread

Connecting credentials makes them available. On hosted CoCalc, each thread
can choose how its future turns are funded.

1. In the thread, click **Codex** to open **Codex settings**.
2. Choose a payment source and click **Save**. **ChatGPT Plan**, **Project
   OpenAI API key**, and **Account OpenAI API key** appear when configured.
   **CoCalc Membership** is available only when the site and account provide
   an included allowance.
3. Check the payment label in the chat controls before submitting work.

**Automatic** prefers your ChatGPT plan, then the project API key, account API
key, and membership allowance. You can continue an established session using
ChatGPT or a personal API key without losing its context. Switching an
established personal session to membership funding is disabled: start a new
chat for the membership's constrained model profile. Returning from an
explicit source to Automatic is also disabled after a session starts.

In Lite, configure a ChatGPT plan or an OpenAI API key in account AI settings;
if both are configured, Lite uses the ChatGPT plan.

## Use project secrets for keys

For code that calls OpenAI directly from a notebook, script, or terminal, store
the API key as a project secret such as \`OPENAI_API_KEY\`. Do not paste keys
into notebooks, chat messages, shell history, or committed files.

## Why this matters in CoCalc

AI access is both account-level and project-contextual. The account connection
lets Codex work in the UI; project secrets let ordinary code and terminal-native
agents use credentials without turning private tokens into shared content.
