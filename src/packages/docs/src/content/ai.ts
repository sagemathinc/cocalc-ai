## What Codex chat is for

Codex chat is the integrated agent interface in CoCalc-ai. A project chat thread
can include humans and Codex, and Codex can use project-aware tools to inspect
files, run commands, work with notebooks, and make changes.

## Open Codex

1. Open the project.
2. Open the Agents or chat area.
3. Start a Codex thread.
4. Ask a concrete task, including relevant files and constraints.

For terminal-native agents such as Claude Code or opencode, install and run them
inside a normal project terminal. CoCalc provides the durable Linux environment;
those tools provide their own agent interface.

## Choose model, reasoning, and speed

Click **Codex** in a thread's chat controls to open **Codex settings**. These
settings apply to the selected thread; the compact chat controls show the
same model and reasoning level.

1. Under **Model and session**, select a **Model**.
2. Choose a **Reasoning level** from the options supported by that model.
   Recheck it after changing models, because the available levels and default
   can change.
3. Choose **Standard** or **Fast** under **Speed**, then click **Save**.

Fast is available only for supported models and uses more Codex credits.
Choose it when lower latency is worth the higher usage; Standard is the
default. Changing to a model without Fast support returns speed to Standard.

Membership-funded turns use the model, reasoning, and speed selected by
CoCalc, so those controls are constrained. Connect and select a personal
ChatGPT plan or OpenAI API key when you need other available model settings.
These choices configure future turns rather than rewriting earlier replies.

## Give better tasks

Name files, describe the desired outcome, and ask Codex to validate changes.
For live notebooks, ask Codex to use the live notebook APIs. For UI actions,
docs action ids such as \`settings.environment.secrets\` let agents open the
right panel directly.

## Why this matters in CoCalc

CoCalc is both a collaborative workspace and an agent sandbox. Humans can review
what Codex changes, keep terminals and notebooks running, use TimeTravel, and
share the same project state with collaborators.

export const AI_CREDENTIALS_BODY = String.raw`
## What AI credentials are for

CoCalc-ai uses OpenAI access for integrated Codex chat. A user can connect a
ChatGPT subscription or configure an OpenAI API key, depending on what access
the deployment and account support.

## Connect access for Codex

1. Open Codex or the AI settings area.
2. Choose **Sign in with ChatGPT** or configure an OpenAI API key.
3. Complete the device authorization or key setup flow.
4. Return to the Codex thread and start a concrete task.

If device authorization is running, keep the authorization panel visible until
the browser confirms that the account is connected.

## Use project secrets for keys

For code that calls OpenAI directly from a notebook, script, or terminal, store
the API key as a project secret such as \`OPENAI_API_KEY\`. Do not paste keys
into notebooks, chat messages, shell history, or committed files.

## Why this matters in CoCalc

AI access is both account-level and project-contextual. The account connection
lets Codex work in the UI; project secrets let ordinary code and terminal-native
agents use credentials without turning private tokens into shared content.
