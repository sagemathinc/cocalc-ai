DivTempHeight:

This component renders a div with an specified height
then **after the render  is committed to the screen** immediately
removes the height style. This is needed because when codemirror
editors are getting rendered, they have small initially, then
full height only after the first render... and that causes
a major problem with virtuoso.  To reproduce without this:

1. Create a notebook whose first cell has a large amount of code,
so its spans several page, and with a couple more smaller cells.
2. Scroll the first one off the screen entirely.
3. Scroll back up -- as soon as the large cell scrolls into view
there's a horrible jump to the middle of it.  This is because
the big div is temporarily tiny, and virtuoso does NOT use
absolute positioning, and when the div gets big again, everything
gets pushed down.

The easiest hack to deal with this, seems to be to record
the last measured height, then set it for the initial render
of each item, then remove it.
