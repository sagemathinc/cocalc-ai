# Chat

## TODO

- [ ] #bug the scroll position for very long chatrooms jumps to the top sometimes on background and focus

- [x] #feature  make it so each thread can have a custom color and icon.  the whiteboard code (in frame-editors/whiteboard-editor) has a pretty general color selector, which we can use.  There's also an icon selector there. We could do something based on that -- quick search, then click.  Use the thread "rename..." dialog to customize this stuff.   Show the icon and color in various places, eg., thread title to the left, and maybe across bottom (above composer).
