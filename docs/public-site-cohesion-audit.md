# Public Site Cohesion Audit

Running checklist for the public-site redesign work. Keep this file updated as
recommendations are evaluated, completed, or deliberately deferred.

## Jupyter And Teaching Pass

- [x] Re-inspect `/features/jupyter-notebook` and `/features/teaching` against the component-necessity standard after the broader feature-page cleanup.
- [x] Jupyter: reduce the hero to one public promise and move detailed agent mechanics behind the existing modal.
- [x] Jupyter: collapse four proof cards to three distinct visitor benefits: persistent runs, live collaboration, and review/recovery.
- [x] Jupyter: remove the separate final thesis section because it repeated the project-context argument already made earlier.
- [x] Teaching: keep course management positioned as a workflow destination beside the LMS, not an LMS replacement or top-level product path.
- [x] Teaching: collapse overlapping grading, nbgrader, help, setup, and environment sections into fewer visitor questions.
- [x] Teaching: preserve route-specific next steps for hosted use, product-path comparison, environment guidance, Jupyter, and teaching support.
- [x] Update focused tests for stale headings, duplicate headings, decorative metadata, CTA route discipline, and repeated section density.

## Current Feature-Page Pass

- [x] Re-inspect `/features/ai`, `/features/terminal`, `/features/linux`, `/features/api`, `/features/whiteboard`, `/features/latex-editor`, and `/features/slides` against the component-necessity standard.
- [x] Use desktop screenshots to identify pages that are visually or conceptually heavy before editing.
- [x] Replace generic feature-card labels with visitor-situation labels where the current copy feels like metadata.
- [x] Consolidate or remove repeated page-level sections on LaTeX, Terminal, Linux, and Whiteboard.
- [x] Keep API lightweight and route-specific; make documentation/support the primary evaluation path.
- [x] Update tests so generic labels, decorative tags, stale/internal language, and vague CTA routes regress visibly.
- [x] Run focused feature tests, typecheck, lint, browser QA, preview rebuild, and commit.

## Current-Pass Change Rationale

- [x] AI: changed generic card headings like "Rich prompts" into task-oriented labels so the page reads as agent workflow guidance instead of a capability list.
- [x] Terminal: removed the full-width Codex process strip because terminal state, collaboration, and agent access were already explained elsewhere on the page.
- [x] Linux: removed the full-width reusable-environment process strip because it pushed the public page toward operations documentation; kept the concept in the course/team environment section.
- [x] Linux: shifted public wording from "RootFS images" toward "reusable environment images" while preserving the technical guide link.
- [x] Whiteboard: removed lower-priority format/realtime cards and kept collaboration as a decision bullet so the page focuses on explaining computational ideas.
- [x] LaTeX: removed repeated recovery/collaboration panels and merged the final CTA into the comparison section so the page has one ending.
- [x] API: made documentation and contextual support the primary next steps because API evaluators usually need integration details before a generic account action.

## Carry-Forward Reviews

- [x] Revisit `/features/jupyter-notebook`; it is improved but still needs a fresh density and hierarchy review.
- [x] Revisit `/features/teaching`; it is improved but still has heavy sections that should be re-evaluated against the same standard.
- [ ] Continue checking whether each feature page explains workflow value before product operating model.
- [ ] Continue checking that every CTA preserves page context and points to the most useful next step.

## Site-Wide Principles Learned

- [x] Avoid decorative tags and repeated metadata when the section heading already carries the meaning.
- [x] Do not make non-clickable labels visually compete with clickable cards.
- [x] Keep cards for scannable choices or genuinely distinct concepts, not for every fact.
- [x] Remove arrows or progression indicators when the visitor is not meant to read a sequence.
- [x] Prefer public buyer/user language over internal planning language.
- [x] Preserve CoCalc Star as a bounded single-VM product path.
- [x] Preserve teaching/course management as a workflow destination, not a top-level product or LMS replacement.
